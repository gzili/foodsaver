# FoodSaver

Waste food sharing at any scale.

## Vision

Reduce food waste by developing a platform where everyone from individuals to large food chains can post redundant food offers.

## Roadmap

### First Release

- [ ] Account registration & login
- [ ] Posting of food offers by registered users
- [ ] Public listing of all currently active offers

### Second Release

- [ ] Reservation of offers for pickup later
- [ ] Tracking of pickup status on both ends
- [ ] Display of pickup location as a point on the map
- [ ] Database

### Third Release

- [ ] Templates - save commonly used food data for reuse in future offers
- [ ] Full integration with Google Maps (display all pickup locations in the map, clicking one should take to the offers page for that location)
