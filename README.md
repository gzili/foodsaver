# FoodSaver

Waste food sharing at any scale.

## Vision

Reduce food waste by developing a platform where everyone from individuals to large food chains can post redundant food offers.

## Goal

Build a React powered SPA (Single Page Application), using ASP.NET framework as an API backend and PostgreSQL as data persistence database.

## Roadmap

### First Release

- [ ] Account registration & login
- [ ] User-posted food offers
- [ ] Public listing of all currently active offers

### Second Release

- [ ] Offer reservation for pickup
- [ ] Pickup status tracking on both ends
- [ ] Display of pickup location as a point on the map
- [ ] Data persistence in a database

### Third Release

- [ ] Templates - save commonly used food data for reuse in future offers
- [ ] Full integration with Google Maps (display all pickup locations in the map, clicking a location brings up an offers page)
